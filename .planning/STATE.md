# Project State: Quiz Bowl RL Buzzer (Unified)

**Project:** Quiz Bowl RL Buzzer (Unified System)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25
**Current Sprint:** Milestone 1

## Project Reference

### Core Value
A principled, modular RL system that produces rigorous experimental results — S_q scoring, baseline comparisons, calibration metrics, and ablation controls — for the CS234 writeup, while supporting both lightweight belief-feature policies and T5-based semantic policies.

### Current Focus
Building unified system by merging qb-rl's modular architecture with qanta-buzzer's T5 integration. Critical path: data pipeline → environment → T5 likelihood → MLP policy → evaluation.

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 - Data Pipeline Foundation
**Current Plan:** 2 of 5

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Derive 6 phases from requirements | Natural groupings: data, environment, baselines+T5, training, evaluation, optional T5 policy | 2026-02-25 |
| Phase 1-5 critical path | Delivers MLP policy with T5 likelihood - core contribution | 2026-02-25 |
| Phase 6 optional | T5 policy is stretch goal given tight deadline | 2026-02-25 |
| Support T5-base fallback | Memory constraints may require smaller model | 2026-02-25 |
| Unified column name support | Accept both QANTA (Text/Answer) and generic formats | 2026-02-25 |
| Hash-based ID generation | Use MD5 for deterministic unique IDs when not provided | 2026-02-25 |
| Cumulative prefix pre-computation | Build all prefixes during loading to avoid repeated operations | 2026-02-25 |
| Use YAML for configuration | Human-readable, standard in ML projects, supports comments | 2026-02-25 |
| Dot notation for CLI overrides | Easy experimentation without editing files (e.g., data.K=5) | 2026-02-25 |

### Architecture Decisions
- Four-layer modular architecture: Pipeline → Agent → Environment → Model
- Dual policy support: MLP on belief features vs T5 end-to-end
- T5 serves dual purpose: likelihood model and optional policy
- YAML configuration with factory methods
- Gymnasium-compliant environment
- SB3 PPO for MLP policy, custom for T5 policy

### Known Issues
None yet

### Technical Debt
- Two existing codebases to merge (qb-rl and qanta-buzzer)
- Different observation spaces (numeric beliefs vs text)
- Memory requirements for T5-large (may need T5-base)

### Performance Bottlenecks
None identified yet

## Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
- Executed Plan 01-01: Data Pipeline Foundation
- Created TossupQuestion dataclass matching qb-rl structure
- Implemented QANTADatasetLoader for CSV parsing with ||| delimiters
- Built text normalization utilities with edge case handling
- Created test dataset with 10 sample questions
- Fixed normalize_answer bug for articles-only input

### Next Session Priority
1. Execute Plan 01-02: MC Dataset Construction
2. Implement distractor generation strategies
3. Create MCQuestion dataclass
4. Build dataset splitter and balancing utilities

### Context for Next Claude
This is a CS234 final project due this week. We're merging two existing codebases:
- qb-rl: Has the modular architecture we want (Gymnasium env, belief features, S_q metric, baselines)
- qanta-buzzer: Has T5 integration we need (encoder, policy heads, supervised warm-start)

The novel contribution is using T5 as a likelihood model to compute beliefs for an MLP policy, then comparing with T5 as an end-to-end policy. Phase 1-5 is the critical path for the deadline. Phase 6 (T5 policy) is optional if time permits.

Key risks to watch:
- Scope explosion (stick to critical path)
- Memory issues with T5-large (have T5-base ready)
- Observation space incompatibility (keep interfaces clean)
- Belief state collapse (pre-compute answer profiles)

### Open Questions
1. Should we start with existing qanta-buzzer data loading or rebuild from qb-rl?
2. Is supervised warm-start necessary for T5 policy or just helpful?
3. What's the optimal time penalty coefficient for reward shaping?
4. Should we implement all 4 baselines or just threshold for MVP?
